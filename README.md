A collaberation with a partner who chooses to stay anonymous.


-Our goal was to make a small python package to be subtly installed on a target machine. 

-Following this the code will download necessery python modules, before discretely taking screenshots of the target machine periodically. 

-Once screenshots have been taken, they will be discretely stored on the target machine in a hidden place within their own directory. 

-Once ready the screenshots can be called and uploaded to the attacker by a variation of methods from emailing to directly uploading to private servers. 

-We later moved onto other projects before making a fully varied system for sending the screenshots to the attacker as we had no use for this program. Me and my partner 
were just hoping to make a 'proof of concept' of a small, tight package to spy on a target machine from a variation of delivery methods from USB style attacks to hiding 
within an untrusted download.


=== At no point has this program been deployed on machines other than virtual machines within our own private network. We DO NOT CONDONE OR PERMIT unethical use of our code ===
